= AsciiDoc Blog
Sebastian Daschner

A Java EE blog application with Git and AsciidoctorJ integration. Connects with a Git repository where the blog posts
-- written in AsciiDoc -- are managed.

Processes the blog posts to HTML snippets via AsciidoctorJ.

Tested with Wildfly 8.2. A separate Wildfly Module is needed because of the JRuby integration of AsciidoctorJ.
See https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj#running-asciidoctorj-on-wildfly-as[Running AsciidoctorJ on WildFly AS].

When deploying on Wildfly, the `servlet-container` configuration has to be set to `allow-non-standard-wrappers="true"`
for allowing the View message body writer to forward the request to a JSP view.
