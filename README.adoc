= AsciiDoc Blog
Sebastian Daschner

A Java EE blog application with Git and AsciidoctorJ integration. Connects with a Git repository where the blog posts
-- written in AsciiDoc -- are managed.

Processes the blog posts to HTML snippets via AsciidoctorJ and renders them on the fly with Mustache templates.

Tested with Wildfly 8.2. A separate Wildfly Module is needed because of the JRuby integration of AsciidoctorJ.
See https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj#running-asciidoctorj-on-wildfly-as[Running AsciidoctorJ on WildFly AS].
